Observation / Issue: I read through the original README and the updated README, the latter provided a fantastic overview of the application and how to use it. It was a very professional, refined document. It covered privacy, information storage, use, troubleshooting, system requirements etc – and when I used the application, I was able to follow the README well.  
Suggested Improvement: The only improvements I would suggest are superficial in nature:  
•	There were occasional spelling mistakes which makes the project feel slightly less professional.  
•	I also felt as a user that there was a lot of text with not a lot to break that up, both in the documentation and in the app. Being someone who gets easily overwhelmed by a lot of text, I think the success of the app could be improved by adding game graphics to the README documentation (and as suggested in your own ‘Future Development’ section some ASCII art or formatting). It would allow you to start imagining the game a lot quicker and spark more interest.  
Considering this game discusses ancient manuscripts, skeletons and the like – including quick to make graphics (thanks ChatGPT) could enhance the readability and interest in your documentation.  
Action Taken: - Spelling Corrections and formatting improvements were reviewed, identified and corrected. Visual Enhancements will implemented in the future.
Status: Completed

Observation / Issue: For my review, I looked at `readme.md` and `updated_readme.md`. There is a huge difference between the 2 documents - I love how much your team worked on improving this! Here are some call outs for things I really liked in the `updated_readme.md` document:  
•	Clearly laid out and well formatted document.  
•	"Features of the Game" gives a nice overview of what to expect when playing this game.  
•	Easy to follow "Setup & Installation" guide.  
•	The screenshot included in the "Map & Movement" section (under "How to Play") is a great visual aid and helps with understanding the rest of the instructions.  
•	The "Ethical Considerations" section is excellent - very comprehensive!  
•	The "Libraries Utilised" section was interesting to learn more about the native Python libraries and how they can be used.  
•	The "Future Development" section is very cool to see what you have planned for future iterations!  
Suggested Improvement: Overall, the `updated_readme.md` document is a huge improvement to the original `readme.md`. I can see that your team put a lot of thought into this. Therefore, the suggestions I have are minimal:  
•	Setup & Installation - Installation Steps: Step 3 is to navigate to the project's containing folder. The command provided for this is `cd path/to/project/Python_RPG/test/main.py` (this path is for the file itself). This should to be updated to `cd path/to/project/Python_RPG/test` (i.e., remove `main.py` from the end).  
•	How to Play: This section would benefit from having some screenshots or code blocks of the terminal output (i.e., example gameplay). If wanting to keep the readme streamlined, you could create an additional file (like a "Visual Guide") that shows the example gameplay. This would assist users in understanding the expected output, which is useful for verifying the game is running as intended. It could also assist in making the game more enjoyable, as the user can get a better idea of what to expect (e.g., pacing of the game, combat style, etc.) before they start playing the game itself. Having a visual guide could also be useful for marketing purposes (i.e., being able to visually show what your application does may entice more people to want to play).  
•	Example Code Documentation:	I really like how you've explained a function and class in here, and included things like the purpose, usage, etc. I would love if you included some more examples, as they're very interesting to read!  
Action Taken: All visual enhancements were presented and will implemented in the future.
