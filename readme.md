# Perilous Python V1.0 #

Welcome to the first iteration of my first Python based Game!

The game is designed only using python, currently.

The game is a text based Adventure/RPG

- The aim of the game is simple, to find the ancient demon and defeat them.
- Features of the game;
  - Turn based combat that uses dice rolls to modify damage/defences.
  - Exploration is encouraged as there are events/items to discover to enrich the player experience.
  - Fully functioning inventory, at this stage effect health/attack rating in future iterations plan to include triggers and item based quests.

- The game is set on a column based map, a1 -d4. Navigation is simple at this stage but will be iterated upon in further development.

## Setup/Install ##

To run this code based game you will need the following installed.

1. VS Code running at the current version, or another code interpreting software (sublime, Atom etc.)
2. Python language installed to version 3.12.3.
3. No packages need to be installed libraries that have been utilised do not require any installation.
4. Ensure you are currently in the same file location as the main.py file otherwise the program will not execute.

## System Requirements ##

- Operating system, minimum Windows 10 or Mac OS 10.11 or later or Ubuntu 16.04+ for linux.
- Processor 1.6GHz or faster
  - 4GB of RAM
  - VS code only requires 500mb of storage & this application would be smaller than this.
  - Display resolution recommended is 1024 by 768 as a minumum.
  - No GPU requirements as all code based.

### Running Program ###

To run the program, simply enter the below into your terminal.
