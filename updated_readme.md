### A Text-Based Adventure Game Built in Python

Welcome to Perilous Python, a beginner-friendly text-based RPG played entirely in the terminal.
Your goal is simple: explore the land, battle enemies, and ultimately defeat the Ancient Demon that has cursed the realm.

This project was developed as part of a software development learning module to demonstrate Object Oriented Programming, file handling,error management, and ethical programming practices.

## Purpose of the Application

Perilous Python was created to combin learning with creativity, allowing players to experience an RPG adventure while developers gain hands on practice with Python fundamentals.

The project demonstrates:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through classes like `Character`, `Enemy`, and `Inventory`.
2. File Input/Output using JSON for saving and loading progress.
3. Error Handling & Logging through Python’s built-in `logging` library.
4. Randomisation via dice rolls to determine combat outcomes.

## Features of the Game

- Turn-Based Combat: Uses dice rolls to decide attack and defense results.
- Exploration: Move across a grid-style map from A1–D4, uncovering events and enemies.
- Inventory System: Collect and use items that affect health, attack, and defense.
- Save & Load Game: Store and reload progress using JSON.
- Boss Encounters: Includes both a main and optional boss.
- Error Logging: Combat errors are automatically logged for developer review.

## Setup & Installation

### Requirements

- Python: Version 3.12.3 or higher
- Code Editor: VS Code, PyCharm, Atom, or Sublime
- OS: Windows 10+, macOS 10.11+, or Ubuntu 16.04+
- No external packages need to be installed. All libraries used are built into Python and require no additional setup.

### System Requirements
1. OS: Windows 10+, macOS 10.11+, choice of terminal (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04)
2. Processor: 1.6GHz dual-core or faster
3. Memory (RAM): 4GB
4. Storage: < 500MB
5. Display: laptop or computer display size is sufficient
6. GPU: Not required (text-based game)

### Installation Steps

1. Get the Project Files - Download or clone this repository on your terminal.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cooper-W1408/Python_RPG.git
```
2. Open the project folder in your chosen code editor. For VScode, type in your terminal:
```bash
code .
```
3. Navigate to the Project Directory containing `main.py`– Use the terminal to move into the project's folder: 
```bash
cd path/to/project/Python_RPG/test
```
4. Run the program with:
 ``` python
python3 main.py
```

## How to Play

The game provides interactive prompts throughout — simply follow on-screen text to explore, fight, and survive.

### Map & Movement

The map is a 4x4 grid labeled A1–D4, representing rows (A–D) and columns (1–4).
You move by typing "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT" or "RIGHT" in the terminal. 
For example, if you are at B2 and type UP in the terminal, your new location becomes A2.

### Combat

- Combat begins automatically when you enter certain zones.
- Battles are turn based, using dice rolls to decide hit or miss.

Example:

  ```
  You roll a 15 and hit the Skeleton for 10 damage!
  The Skeleton retaliates and hits you for 6 damage.
  ```
- Roll a 20 for a "Critical Hit", dealing double damage!

### Saving & Loading

- Type "save" or "save_game" to save progress anytime.
- Type "load" in the main menu to resume your saved game.
- Save files store stats, inventory, and events — enemies will respawn when you reload to maintain difficulty.

### Interactions

- Type "look" to observe your surroundings.
- Type "interact" to trigger events or collect items.

## Example Code Documentation

### Function Example: "roll_dice()"

```python
def roll_dice(sides=6):
    """Rolls a dice and returns a random number between 1 and 'sides'."""
    return random.randint(1, sides)
```

- Purpose: Adds excitement and unpredictability to combat.
- Parameter: "sides" which is the number of dice sides (default = 6).
- Returns: A random integer from 1 to the chosen side count.
- Usage: Simulates dice rolls for hit/miss and critical hit outcomes.

### Class Example: "Player"

```python
class Player:
    """Represents the player character."""
    def __init__(self, name, health, attack, defense):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.attack = attack
        self.defense = defense
```

- Purpose: Defines player attributes for combat and progression.
- Used By: Game engine and combat system.
- Variables: Name, health, attack, and defense.
- Inheritance: None, this is a standalone class.

## Ethical Considerations
This CLI application was developed with a strong commitment to ethical coding practices. We believe that even lightweight tools should respect users’ rights, foster inclusivity, and promote transparency. Below are the key principles guiding our development:
### Privacy and Data Protection
We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. All logs and save files remain local to the user's device. No telemetry, analytics, or remote tracking tools are used. This ensures full user control and aligns with ethical standards for data minimization and transparency.
### Accessibility and Inclusivity
The application is designed to run in standard terminal environments with minimal system requirements. We use clear language, intuitive commands, and simple outputs to support users of all technical backgrounds. Color-coded messages (when used) follow accessibility guidelines, and help flags (--help) are available for every command.
### Transparency and Clarity
All features, behaviors, and dependencies are documented. We avoid hidden processes or assumptions, and provide clear instructions for installation, usage, and troubleshooting. The source code is open and readable, allowing users to understand and modify the tool freely.
### Error Handling and Safety
We implement structured error handling to prevent crashes and confusion. Errors are logged locally and explained in plain language. Input validation is used to avoid unintended consequences, and destructive actions (like file overwrites) require explicit confirmation.
### Respect for User Autonomy
Users retain full control over how they use, modify, and share the application. There are no forced updates, background processes, or locked features. We encourage customization and provide guidance for adapting the tool to individual needs.

## Libraries Utilised
1. random
- The random library is used to generate random numbers or make random selections
- Used in this terminal app to generate random dice rolls
2. json
- Used to work with JSON data to store data 
- Used in this terminal app so users can save their stats (name, health power, attack) so they can come back later and continue playing the game
3. sys (system)
- The sys library (short for system) lets Python code interact directly with the system that’s running it, in this case the terminal terminal
- For this terminal app, it’s mainly used to exit or terminate the program safely when the player chooses to quit.
4. os (Operating system)
- The os library allows the Python program communicate directly with the computers files, folders, and terminal commands.
- In this terminal app, it’s mainly used to clear the terminal screen so that every menu or update looks clean and easy to read.

## Error Handling
- This game included error handling to ensure smooth gameplay and easier debugging
- The logging library automatically creates a file named `Combat_errors.log`.
- If errors occur during gameplay, they’re recorded for review.
- Players can forward this log to the development team for bug reports.

## Feedback Log

## Future Development
As this is a learning project, upcoming beginner-friendly improvements include:

- Expanded Map System: Add more grid locations or unlock new zones after defeating bosses.
- Simple Quest System: Introduce basic side quests that reward health potions or weapons.
- Visual Enhancements: Use ASCII art or color formatting (e.g., via the rich library) to make the game more immersive.
- Difficulty Settings: Include “easy,” “normal,” and “hard” modes to adjust enemy health and attack.

## Team Section
At the time the project was defined, the team initially consisted of Cooper, Lorena, and Tamara—listed in alphabetical order.
Although Cooper was part of the original group and his project was selected for development, his engagement gradually declined during the execution phase. Aside from sharing his CLI project repository, he did not contribute to the work. Eventually, on Thursday, October 23rd, he left the group without providing any explanation.
